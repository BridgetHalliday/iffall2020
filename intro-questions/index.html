        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Bridget Halliday. I'm a Communication Design major and a junior.</p>
        <p>2. I'm taking this class because a) it's required for me and b) because I'm genuinely interested in learned a bit of coding!</p>
        <p>3. I have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <p>4. I hope to have just a better understanding of coding since I'm coming to this class with no previous knowledge.</p>
        <p>5. Designing on screen allows for more flexibility with how you're communicating, such as using motion!</p>
        <p>6. https://www.flourishagency.com I think Flourish does a great job of using color and motion and hierarchy. The transitions between pages on their site is also really well done.</p>
        <p>7. https://www.nm.org I think Northwestern Medicine is an example of a website with effective communication. It is easy to navigate and the most important/common uses of the website are clearly displayed on the home page</p>
        <p>8. https://www.americangirl.com While this choice may seem silly or childlike, American Girl's website does a great job at handling both adults shopping for kids and kids playing games. They've made a complex website feel simple.</p>
