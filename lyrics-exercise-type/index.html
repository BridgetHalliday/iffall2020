            <p>As cold as an old ice cream sandwich</p>
            <p>As focused as Mr. Miyagi</p>
            <p>You poke a your phone postin' aerial photos</p>
            <p>Of you with your smoothie</p>
            <p>I can't keep on makin' you happy</p>
            <p>'Cause you got issues with your daddy</p>
            <p>I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you</p>
            <p>And your gran in home movies</p>

            <p>But I wish I could show you more of yourself</p>
            <p>I wish I could make you somebody else</p>
            <p>But I left it way too late</p>
            <p>Are you stuck in your own ways?</p>

            <p>Do this for me</p>
            <p>Hands, knees, please</p>

            <p>You let the Devil in</p>
            <p>And all you talk is money, money</p>
            <p>Money, money, money</p>
            <p>It's so funny how it changes how you feel</p>
            <p>How you see, how you need, how you sleep (whoa)</p>
            <p>All your freedom, caffeine</p>
            <p>How you're lookin' at me</p>
            <p>But I love it when the light sits on you just right</p>
            <p>Tiny tangerine speckles painted in your eyes</p>

            <p>You've been dreamless and sleepin' for years</p>
            <p>clear since the late 1990s</p>
            <p>You only look at me properly now</p>
            <p>When you're drunk, watchin' movies</p>
            <p>Where are you? What happened?</p>
            <p>I want what we had, where you gone? Where you hidin'?</p>
            <p>It's 2:23, you got Friends on repeat</p>
            <p>On repeat, on repeat, on repeat</p>
            <p>On repeat, on re-</p>
